# Web Development Project 5 - *Data Dashboard*

Submitted by: **Kobe Jordan**

This web app: **A dynamic food recipe explorer that fetches data from the Spoonacular API to help users discover recipes based on their dietary preferences. Users can search recipes by name, filter by diet types (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, etc.), and view key nutritional statistics. The dashboard presents recipe information in an elegant card layout with images, calorie counts, and diet tags, making it easy to find the perfect recipe for any dietary need.**

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total
